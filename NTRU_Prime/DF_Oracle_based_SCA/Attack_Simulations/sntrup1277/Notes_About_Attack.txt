(3f.c) mod 3.

Only -1, 0 or 1.

Say, you choose 3c > q/2.
You get -1...
Say, you choose 3c < q/2.
You get 0...

This will be enough for you to distinguish the two cases. You can then use periodicity to get leaky points for other
coefficients.
You should get leakage at all locations which have either +1/-1... This is the attack.

1. Attacking Unprotected basic Implementation

2. Attacking Vectorized Implementation.
  - p, p-1, p-2, p-3

3. Attacking Shuffled Implementation.
  - Leakage - Get All coefficients and then count the number of 0xFF classes.
  - Take majority voting among atleast 10 times for each query. Then, take the call.
